### Notes

    - Graphs are Non-Linear (vertices and nodes)
    - Connected by line segments(edges)
    - Undirected graphs are undeirected(bi-directional)
    - Directed Graphs where edges are directed. Each node is directed towars another node.
    

## **Undirected Graph**

     a----------b---------c
     |          |         |
     d----------e---------f
     |          |         |
     g----------h---------i

## **Directed Graph**

     a--------> b-------> c
     |          |         |
     v          v         v
     d--------> e-------> f
     ^          ^         v
     |          |         |
     g----------h---------i
