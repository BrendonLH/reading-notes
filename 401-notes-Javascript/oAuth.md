### Questions

1. Why is Oauth important? 
 - a. Oauth was created so that way a service can authorize another service. this is important because it allows the cloud to directly save information without needing a user to download the data and then re upload it to the cloud storage.  

2. Why should we be careful about storing a users password?
 - a. User passwords are very sensitive. They should never be stored in plain text but instead encrypted. 

3. What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
 - a. Hashing converts data to a number generated from a string of text and encryption uses algorithms and a key to convert the message into an unrecongnizable format.

4. What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
 - a. Encoding is publicly available so that it can be easily reversed. Encryption uses secret keys. 

5. What is a token used for?
 - a. The token is used like an electronic key to allow certain permissions. The token grants Authorization from one service to the other. 

### Vocabulary Terms

**Authenitication:** 
    - determines who is accessing.
**Authorization:**

**Session:**

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?

    1. What a token actually does and is used for. 
    2. The difference between hashing and encrypting
    3. authorization vs authentication

2. Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?

    1. More about secret keys.
    2. What all can a token do other than permissions and access.
    3. cookies, why do we need them.

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?

    1. I am mostly excited about encryption, anything security is a big buisness and pays top dollar so the more I can learn the better.
