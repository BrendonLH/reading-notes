### Questions

1. Why do we use Hash Tables? 
    - Hash Tables hold unique key values, They work as a sort of dictionary to lookup things in an orderly manner, Stores data similar to a library. 

2. What is Hashing? 
    - Hashing turns a Key or any value into a integer. They must be determined by the input.

3. What are Buckets? 
    - Buckets are the amount of different initial keys that can be stored. For instance if I set my bucket limit to 2 then only 2 different hash keys can be stored and we will get a lot of collisions resulting in more nodes being linked together in each Hashed key.
