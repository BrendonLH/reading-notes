### Engineering Topics
#####    1. Solving Problems
             When Solving a problems in a coding interview, you want to go into the problem with the mindset of "measure twice, cut once". It is very important to Allocate 3/4 of you're time on it just simply understanding the problem itself. 
            
            Break down the problem into babysteps. Make sure that you are translating it simply at first, then add the psuedo code, then fill in the psuedo code and finally optimize. 

#####    2.  Act like you make 1000$/hr
            Business. The most successful people are not busy, they are focused. The difference is being busy is just wasting time for a small shot of satisfaction, being focused accomplishes things in a shorter amount of time with quality results. Being focused allows a person to work on things that are in keeping with their mission/goal. Do not waste your time being busy, use your time as if it is worth something. 
            
            Say no to more things as alot of the things you say yes to are not in line with what you really want. For every 10 ideas, say no to 9. Dont look for the good, seek out the great, saying no to things allows you to seek out more oppertunities that would have been missed if you said yes and wasted your time.  
#####    3. How to think like a programmer
            When it comes to problems solving, Less is more. Start off by identifying the problem. If you cant describe the problem then you dont understand it. Break down the problem into smaller pieces. If something is too hard, make it simpler and then solve that and expand outward. Find a simliar problem that is easier, solve it and apply it to the harder problem. DEBUG DEBUG DEBUG. Look at where the problem is causing issues and work from there. Dont try to paint the whole picture, solve it piece by piece. Last, if you cant solve it, Google has an answer, you just gotta click search.
#####    4. The 5 whys
            When encountering a problem, ask "why". Asking why will give a reason that can be followed up with anoyher why if needed. Asking why will eventually bring out the root problem. Make sure the answers are not vague but as specific as possible. This will allow a more apporachable solution. The goal is to create a preventative solution rather than just a bandaid for the problem at hand.
