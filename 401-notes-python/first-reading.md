## Pain and Suffering

 what i took away from this post was that during the class, it will be difficult. there will be a steep challenge curve. I think the best way to combat the frustration that is going to accompany the new learning material is by practicing and asking for help when I am stuck. 

 for me personally, its never been so much about my ability or if something is difficult. it has mostly been things that are outside my control that make difficult. If I need to learn it, then I will, however, if I am reliant on outside forces to ensure my success then that is a difficulty that cannot be alleviated. 

 ## Big O 
- O(1)
    executes in the same time or space regardless of the data
- O(N)
    performance that will grow in proportion to the size of the data set.
- O(N^2)
    space and time proportionate to the sqaure of the data set. common among nested loops or iterations.
- O(2^N)
    the growth doubles with each addition to the data set.

## Things I want to know more about

I would like to see more examples of what algorithms pertain to what Big O.
