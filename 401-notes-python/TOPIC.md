# Pandas

## Pandas Getting Started
- importing pandas
  - import Pandas as pd
- for storing data with pandas
  - create using Dataframe
  - stores as a 2 dimensional array
    - the values can be integers,floats and other different data types.
    - similar to sql tables

  after reading the pandas material provided, Pandas is very powerful when it comes to using built in methods on Numpy arrays. Being able to read files such as excel will be very useful not to mention the ability to export data to a excel like format. 

## Things I want to know more about

I want to know more about exporting the data to the front end. I have used XLXS conversion to take excel and convert it to an object before then using that data to create a new table for the user to read and use. I think python would probably do it better with Pandas.
