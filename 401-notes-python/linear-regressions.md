# Reading notes Class 13 

## Linear Regressions

- there are many options to implement linear regression in python. this includes numpy,scipy, stats model and sckit learn.
- Regression in general is looking at relationships aong variables.
- we try to use regression to predict a possible outcome or see how things are related.

 ### Sckit Learn
 - sckit learn has many built in methods, you can import test data, use that data to transform it into a pandas dataframe and plot it on mapplot lib.


## Things I want to know more about
- data science is incredibly boring. Just reading it is soooo draining on my motivation. I guess if I want to know anything, its where I would apply this in an application. Would I use it to plot out popular items compared to non popular? would I use it to help predict user actions? is it strictly for data science and used for experiments and research? How does this help me be a more productive programmer?
