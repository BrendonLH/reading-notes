# Readings Hash Tables Notes

## Topic : Hash Tables

### Article 1
- Hashing is a way to assign unique numbers to values in order for a quick lookup.
- (key Terms)
    - Hash Function
        - Easy to compute: It should be easy to compute and must not become an algorithm in itself.
        - Uniform distribution: It should provide a uniform distribution across the hash table and should not result in clustering.
        - Less collisions: Collisions occur when pairs of elements are mapped to the same hash value. These should be avoided.
    - Hash Table
        - A data structure that stores key value pairs.

    

## Things I want to Know more about
- After reading through the articles, I am still kinda confused about alot of the terminology used in the articles. I think I understand the main concept of a hash table. Its designed to store unique identifiers for easy lookup. A good hash needs to be able to avoid collisions. I will need to Read more and watch more videos.
