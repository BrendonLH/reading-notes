### What is Jupyter Lab
  - Allows you to work with documents such as text editors, terminals and custom componenets.
  - jupyter notebooks allows a user to work with files and data seamlessly(what does this mean).
  - works similar to an IDE except that it works on the web and allows the user to see data right away.
  - the notebooks help data scientists to show how they got the results and also allow the user to perform the results. They are not just static visualizations but actual code that does something.

## Things I want to know more about
- for jupyter, I dont understand the importance of it. Why use it? whats its purpose? what does it do that our standard way of doing things doesnt? is it just a way to have everytthing in one place. from what I gather, I am just learning a new way to do the same tasks but with different commands.
- the jupyter seems like its just a way to user new commands.
