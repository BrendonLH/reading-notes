## How to Use Random Module

- the random module in python supports many differnet functions, one of the most used is the ability to randomize numbers.
    - Randint(low,high)
        - takes two arguments, and returns a random integer from the lowest to the highest number. 
            > **example:**
            >
            >Import random
            >
            > print(random.randint(1,10))
            >
            > console--> 7
    - Choice(list)
        - Choice function returns a random element from a list
            > **example:**
            >
            >import random
            >
            >list = [ 'item1' , 'item2', 'item3' ]
            >
            > print(random.choice(list))
            >
            > console--> item2

## What is Risk Analysis

- risk analysis is identifying risks in applications/software and giving them priority in testing. 

- Using risk analysis allows a dev to highlight problem areas and help mitigate any risks. this allows the dev the create solutions to potential problems at the beggining rather than fixing a problem during production.

- some tools for helping with risk management: 
    1. conduct risk analysis meetings
    2. use max resources to mitigate high risks
    3. create a risk database to be used in the future
    4. set risk magnitude indicators:
        - low 
            - no financial or external exposure/loss
        - med
            - not desirable but tolerable, can lead to minor financial loss
        - high
            - critical, not tolerable, can face financial loss

- perspective of risk assessment
    1. Effect - event, condition or action and its impact
    
    2. Cause - Looking for reason of effect , cause or impact

    3. Liklihood - to identify if a requirement will be 
    satisfied. will the product do what it is supposed to do.
