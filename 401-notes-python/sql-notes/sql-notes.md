# SQL Notes

- I am starting to notice that if i play out and read out what I want to do in my head, I can usually get the syntax pretty easily with sql.
  > **select** population **from** cities **where** country **equals** united states

- I have always struggled with SQL in regards to linking different tables, Joining tables using ids seems like a breeze now. I have always stuck to mongo because of it. But relational DB is the way to go and this solved my problem with wanting to create another table that I can link to a for instance, customer table.
