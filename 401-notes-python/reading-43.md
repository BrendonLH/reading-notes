## Topic : Readings 43

### First Timers Only
- (summary of article)
    - Sites for first open source contributions
- (URLS)
    - [First Contributions](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)
    - [Good First Issues](https://goodfirstissues.com/)
    - [Up for Grabs](https://up-for-grabs.net/#/)
        
- (additional notes)
  - Good sources of open source can be found by just reading the repo's of some of you're favorite technologies. Scour through React or Node and look for simple stuff like misspells or unclear documentation. You don't need to solve a complex problem to contribute, something simple like changing a header or adding readability can be enough to get a commit merged.

    - Treat violations of the Code as inconsistent with membership in the ACM.
        
- (additional notes)
  - I understand the principals of the ACM code, I also wonder how many people in the industry actually adhere to the code. To include Big tech. Sometimes the stories and decisions I hear made by people in positions at the top from big fang seems completely contrary to this set of principals. Case in Point, The article "The Code Im Ashamed Of". It is very hard for me to read that and understand the thought process to move forward with creating a website that directly affects someone's mental and physical health. Chalking it up to "I was young and dumb" is no excuse. If we keep making excuses for the most heinious things, no one will ever be held accountable and the code means nothing.An entire life was destroyed from a drug that was pushed by an algorithm of tests designed to sell a certain drug. 

## Things I want to Know more about
- (pertains to whole topic of reading)
  - For the Ethics and Principals, I would completely agree that this is a good way to pursue programming. I do not believe these principles are adhered to as far as it pertains to how social media drives consumers. I don't think there is explicit ill intent, but I do believe there is the byproduct of bad consumer practices. 
  -  For open source projects, does CodeFellows have an Alumni open source repo? I think it would be cool to have a repo for 401 students. The Idea is once you finish you're whiteboard and you are on track to get the certificate, you can contribute a MD file that acts similar to a github profile readme, with linkes to projects...what langauges and technologies you know, the teams at codefellows you worked with ect, I think it could have anything you want on thereor a specified template, that way each and every dev from codefellows can showcase themselves and future devs and other devs from codefellows have a way to reach out and ask about similar interests to build that initial connection if they are interested in the same part of the industry.
  -  I think the community at Codefellows is great and Fostering it to be as inclusive to all backgrounds really showcases the best part of it.
