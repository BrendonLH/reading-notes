### Encryption, decryption, and cracking
- 
- (key Terms)
    - Ceasar Cipher
        - The Ceasar Cipher, takes an letter and assigs it as a corresponding letter.
        - [C,O,D,E] == [A,X,T,Y]
    - Frequency analysis
        - Analyse the most frequent letter in the message with the most freqently used letter in the alphabet
    - Known plaintext
        - if you know messages always have the same thing in them, you can figure out what those letter are
        - if a message always starts with hello, just apply the know cipher for those letters to the rest of the message
    - Brute force
      - in the shifting scenario, you can try each shift pattern starting at one to the maximum range minus one to see what message makes the most sense.
    - Encryption
      - Scrambling the data
    - Decryption
      - Using a secret key to unscramble the data
    - Code Cracking
      - Get the data un scrambled without a key.
        



## Things I want to Know more about
- I wonder how extravagent you can get with making a cipher for message, Like what is I assign something to a letter then assign that one to a letter ect ect like 20 times, How would I find the pattern?
