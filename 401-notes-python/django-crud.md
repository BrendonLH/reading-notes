## Topic : Django Crud and Forms

### Django Forms
- Models are how to determine how our data will be stored and what it will look like in our database. Models have many attributes.
- (key Terms)
    - HTML forms
        - Can be used to collect information
        - Works with some sort of data storage system
    - Action
        - The resource where data is sent for processing
    - Methods
        - Get, Not to change data, only to "get data"
        - Post, Used to change or manipulate data from the DB, Signup is an example
- The front end handles the initial submission of the form including how the user enters in data. The server/backend handles the request from the form, then does some things to it (validation, sanitation, ect) and then gets or adds to the database. 


## Things I want to Know more about
- I have worked with forms quite a bit. I focus alot on front end with applications because thats my bread and butter and the part I enjoy. Working with forms and requests are integral part of front end if its more than just a static app. I would like to know more about async requests with forms on the backend where stuff is done with the request. Waiting for something to happen from the backend can be very detrimental, so Im wondering how I can make something on the back end to return something in place while waiting. Im thinking about Eccomerce shopping cart kinda thing.
