## Simple Operations
* Using a single slash to divide numbers produces a decimal (or float, as it’s known in programming). We'll dive into floats in the next lesson.
  * examples
    > &check; 4/2 = 2.0

    > &#9746; 4/2 = 2

## Data Types
  * String
    >'Hello World'
  * Integer
    >whole numbers such as **2**
  * Floats
    >Decimal numbers such as **2.0**
  * Booleans
    >Booleans can have two values: **True** and **False**.

## Exponentation
  *  raise one number to the power of another
      *  example
        >2**3 = 8 =(2x2x2)

## Floor Division
  * Floor division is just like a normal division operation except that it returns the largest possible integer
      * example
        >20 **//** 6 = 18 (largest integer possible)
## Modulo Operation
  * carried out with a percent symbol (%)–to get the remainder of a given division
      * example
        >20 **%** 6 = 2 (remainder is 2)

## Strings
  * you can multiply strings with integers
      * example
        >print(3 * '7') = 777

## Variables
  * you can use letters, numbers and underscores but no special symbols.
  * Python is case sensitive
  * cannot start a variable with a number
      * example

        >
        > name = Brendon
        
        > Name = Hampton

        **n**ame != **N**ame
