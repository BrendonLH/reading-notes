# Serverless Function

## What is Serverless?
- serverless means that the developer does not manage the server. You still work with a server, you just dont build it, deploy it, maintain it ect. This allows the dev to focus on the front end side of the development process. Serverless means that someone else is doing all the backend heavy lifting such as Amazon cloud, google cloud, microsoft azure ect.
- with serverless developing, you only pay for what you use. If your server is not running, you are not paying.
- serverless is not just containers and FaaS, it is 

- API gateways
    - provides http routing, client ID's and secrets, CORS functionality

- Time
    - serverless functionality, is measured in milliseconds rather than minutes for other types of models (VM's, PaaS, containers)
    - no administrative burden
    - maintenance is handled by the cloud provider
    - no prbolem with scalablilty

## Final Thoughts
- I did Microsofts basic Azure certification course. I remember thatit specifically talked about that cloud server/database management is going to be the future for most if not all companies. Azure specifically, has data centers around the world that has the same data. for instance, our data stored in the states is actually backed up down in south america, so if all our data up here is lost, it can be retrieved from the backup, it will take alittle time to spin up, however, we would not lose the data. 
- after everything I know about azure, Serveless functions(developing) sounds exactly like that architecture. 

## Things I want to know more about

- I would like to now more about how serverless applies to databases and API calls. Do we still manage routing and the database? or are those part of the services that are handled by the cloud platforms? The article talks about it, but I didnt really understand what it was talking about.
