1. Responsive web design
    a. design a web application to be mobile responsive first then work toward desktop.
    b. sections should not strain the eye when the user is reading so they can get the information they need and move on. 
    c. use @media to set the different browser lengths. 
    d. Using percentages will allow the browser to adapt to the different screen sizes rather than px being a fixed sizing or positioning on the page. 

2. let and const
    a. let will not hoist out of position like var does. it will stay local if inside a function.
    b. const will make a variable name the same and cannot be changed. 
3. SMACSS 
    a. when building CSS files create layouts.css, main.css, modules.css, reset.css, style.css, theme.css
    b. split your css into the different pages and then import into style.css so its only grabbing from one page on index.html
